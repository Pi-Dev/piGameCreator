piGameCreator is open-source multiplatform integrated development environment (IDE) mostly oriented in game development.

The project is started, however, it is still in heavy development phase, thus is not available yet.

piGameCreator is different from the most other game creation softwares, including, but not limited to, Yoyo's Game Maker, Scirra's Construct and Clickteam's Multimedia Fusion and TGF by technical design.

Instead of producing some special kind of data that the base engine will interpret, making the process execution slower, piGameCreator will be a high-level code generator. When you create the game, define the objects behavior, scenes and save your project into the native file format, a language exporter will run and convert the project file to raw high level language, such as C++ or JAVA and then will pass the code to the real compiler for compilation.

The development itself will be based on custom scripting language and on some kind of visual programming. You import the assets - graphics, sounds, models, build object classes and place these in scenes. There will be different kind of pre-made object templates that will help creation of common types of games, for example platformers, 4 and 8-direction way control,  shooting and so on. Empty classes will be allowed for any kind of usage for any custom object types.

While piGameCreator will target mostly 2D game development, 3D features will exist but will be for advanced users only.
