Pi|engine (Pi Engine, formerly piGameCreator) is open-source multiplatform integrated development environment (IDE) mostly oriented in game development.

You can read the blog for this project here: http://blog.pi-dev.com/

The project is started, however, it is still in heavy development phase, thus is not publicly released.

If you manage to compile this source code, the application will be unusable for game development, because the API is not implemented.
You can, however, use this as general purpose Haxe ide with a code completion.

pi|engine is different from the most other game creation software by technical design.

Instead of producing some special kind of data that the base engine interprets, making the process execution slower, Creator IDE is a high-level code generator (thanks to Haxe). When you create the game, define the objects behavior, scenes and save your project into the native file format, a platform exporter will run and convert the project file to raw high level language, such as C++ (using the Haxe compiler) and then will pass the code to the real compiler for compilation (Currently, this works only on Windows and depends on Visual Studio Express).

More info on this project is available here: http://blog.pi-dev.com/about-pi-engine/

To compile the source code: 

1. You will need Qt Creator and Qt 4.8.1 installed.
2. Download the repository, then, DO NOT TOUCH /baseide/Release (you can delete *.o files, the exe and the DLLs, but do not delete other files). Clean all else.
3. Delete the .user files generated by Qt Creator.
4. DO NOT use Shadow building.
4. Build and run. An error should occur, that says "Installation is corrupted"
5. Go to the Run settings in the Qt Creator and set the Working Directory to baseide\release (even for the Debug build!)
6. Run. The IDE should now start. 
7. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Express edition, so haXe compiler can actually build.

NOTE: I haven't Linux mashine to develop and text now. Code is crossplatform-friendly. I do not know how to build this on Linux.
The C++ exporter is located into cppexport folder. If you want to port it you should check its "Run" method.

OUR TODO: We have to implement first basic Win32 version of the engine
